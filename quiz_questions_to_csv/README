This is used to get a breakdown of scores by question number.

Why is this needed?

If you use a question bank, exporting from canvas will give you scores by question ID, not by what number question in the exam.
While this is useful in many contexts, aggregating scores may be useful.

Additionally, this script lets you avoid the clunky Canvas export mechanism.

To use:

1. Edit config.init to include your course ID, quiz ID, and Canvas API Token (see https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-manage-API-access-tokens-as-an-admin/ta-p/89)

2. Run quiz_questions_to_csv.py, the results will be placed in ./points.csv
